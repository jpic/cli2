command: cli2 
retcode: 1
stdout:
Missing arguments: callback

Signature: run(callback, *args, **kwargs)
Execute a python callback on the command line.

To call your.module.callback('arg1', 'argN', kwarg1='foo'):

    cli2 your.module.callback arg1 argN kwarg1=foo

You can also prefix arguments with a dash, those that contain equal sign
will end in dict your_console_script.parser.dashkwargs, those without equal
sign will end up in a list in your_console_script.parser.dashargs.

If you're using the default cli2.console_script then you can import it. If
you don't know what console_script instance, use
cli2.guess_console_script() which will inspect the call stack and return
what it believes is the ConsoleScript instance currently in use.

For examples, try `cli2 debug`.
For other commands, try `cli2 help`.
