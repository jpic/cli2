stdout:
Signature: pytest.skip(msg='', **kwargs)
Skip an executing test with the given message.

This function should be called only during testing (setup, call or teardown) or
during collection by using the ``allow_module_level`` flag.

:kwarg bool allow_module_level: allows this function to be called at
    module level, skipping the rest of the module. Default to False.

.. note::
    It is better to use the :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref` marker when possible to declare a test to be
    skipped under certain conditions like mismatching platforms or
    dependencies.
